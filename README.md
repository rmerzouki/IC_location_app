# Visualization Application for POP and Data center location

The application places the locations on a world map and provides the information: 'type', 'name', 'address', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'capa', 'number' and 'marker_size' by means of a label each time you hover the mouse over a point. The zoom feature allows you to select a specific location. You also have the possibility to select a display by "type" i.e. Equinix, InterCloud, Megaport... Finally, the size of the circles reflects the size of the 'marker_size'.
